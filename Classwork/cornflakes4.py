# Write a function called student_age. This function asks a student to enter their name, and then it returns their
# age. For example, if a user enters 'Precious' as their name, your function should return, 'Hi, Precious,
# you are 27 years old. This function reads data from the database (dictionary below). If the name is not in the
# dictionary, your code should tell the user that their name is not in the dictionary, and ask them for their age.
# Your code should then add the name and age to the dictionary of student_age below. Once added, your code should
# return to the user: "Hi, (added name),you are (added age) years old". Remember to convert the input from user to
# lowercase letters.

# student_age = {"dike":33, "ope":25, "melody":20, "precious":27}
